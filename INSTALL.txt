Oracle Monitor ZenPack Installation Notes

1. Requirements
   - Zenoss >=3.0.3
   - ZenPack SQL Data Source >=1.4 by Egor Puzanov
   - Oracle Client >=10.2
   - cx_Oracle >=5.0.4

2. Installing
2.1 Oracle Client
   Install the Oracle client software, such as the Oracle Instant Client on your Zenoss server.

      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html

   If you have an Oracle Database in the same server, the Oracle client is already installed.

2.2 cx_Oracle
   Download the cx_Oracle Python extension module source.

      http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/

   Extract it to a directory and using the zenoss user run:

      /opt/zenoss/bin/python setup.py install --home /opt/zenoss

   This will install the extension module inside Zenoss. You might need to repeat this step after a Zenoss upgrade.

2.3 Configure
   You'll need to add the following variables to the zenoss user (i.e. in .bashrc)

      ORACLE_HOME = (path to the Oracle Client Home)
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $ORACLE_HOME/lib

   Restart Zenoss.

2.4 ZenPack
   Download and install the Oracle Monitor ZenPack. Don't forget to install the SQL Data Source ZenPack first.

Check the README.txt for usage notes.
