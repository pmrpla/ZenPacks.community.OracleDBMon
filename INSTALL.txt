            * Oracle DB Monitor ZenPack Installation Notes *

1. Requirements
   - Zenoss Core >=3.0.3
   - ZenPack SQL Data Source >=1.4 by Egor Puzanov
   - Oracle Client >=10.2
   - cx_Oracle >=5.0.4

2. Installing
2.1 Oracle Client
   Download and install the Oracle client software, the Oracle Instant Client will do, but you'll need the basic and the SDK.

      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html
      
      e.g.:
      rpm -Uvh oracle-instantclient11.2-basic-11.2.0.2.0.x86_64.rpm
      rpm -Uvh oracle-instantclient11.2-devel-11.2.0.2.0.x86_64.rpm

   If you have an Oracle Database in the same server as Zenoss Core, the Oracle client is already installed.

   You'll need to add the following variables to the zenoss user (i.e. in .bashrc):
      export ORACLE_HOME=(path to the Oracle Client Home)
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib

2.2 cx_Oracle
   Download the cx_Oracle Python extension module source (source code only).

      http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/
      
      e.g. http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cx-oracle/cx_Oracle-5.0.4.tar.gz?download

   Extract it to a directory and using the zenoss user run:

      /opt/zenoss/bin/python setup.py install --home /opt/zenoss

   This will install the extension module inside Zenoss. You might need to repeat this step after a Zenoss upgrade.

2.3 ZenPack
   Download and install the Oracle DB Monitor ZenPack. Don't forget to install the SQL Data Source ZenPack first.

   Restart Zenoss.

Check the README.txt for usage notes.
